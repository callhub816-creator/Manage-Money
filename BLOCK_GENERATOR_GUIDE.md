# How to Generate SEO Blogs with Antigravity

To generate a new blog post, simply give me (Antigravity) a prompt like this:

---
**Prompt Template:**
"Generate a high-quality blog post for my website.
Topic: [Your Topic]
Target Keywords: [Keyword 1, Keyword 2]
Language: [English/Hindi/Hinglish]
Tone: Professional and Helpful
Action: Write the content in HTML format and append it to `src/data/blogs.json` with a unique ID, slug, and a professional Unsplash image URL."
---

### Why this works:
1. **Full SEO**: I will include `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and proper paragraph tags.
2. **Human-Written**: I will use a natural flow, transition words, and informative sections.
3. **Automatic**: I will handle the file editing (JSON) so you don't have to touch any code.
4. **Google Ready**: The `SEO.tsx` component is already integrated into the blog pages to handle meta tags.

### Example:
"Generate a blog about 'How to save money in 2025' and add it to my blog system."
